# Variables
# sotre 5 in the computer's memory
#x = 5
# show the value contained at x on screen  
#puts x
#replace the value of x with 6
#x = 6
#puts x
#x = x +1
#
# puts x

# Combine strings and variables
# store my fav thing in memory
my_favorite_thing = "tacos"
# store a quantity in memory
number_of_things = 3
# display the two together
puts "my order is #{number_of_things} #{my_favorite_thing}"
